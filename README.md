# solid-squircular-aurorae

A KDE Window Decoration based on [vinceliuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice)'s [Jasper KDE](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Jasper-kde) theme.
(It's very beautiful, go check it out)

It has round buttons with thin icons that can be clicked even if you don't center the circle shape exactly (they have a square hitbox, but they are round, hence the name of the decoration (I also am not good at names)).

It has a solid look and it follows the theme color so that it creates a seamless connection with the window.
